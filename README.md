## Introduction
Following my year of training at efficom. I had to create an android application as part of my studies.

Following the purchase of the client's photo kiosk, an event code was created so that the client could see all the photos.
Then to like and disliker, but also to share the photos that wish to be disliked.

this project is in connection with the ecommerce website

## API
API is an acronym for Applications Programming Interface. An API is therefore a programming interface that allows you to "plug in" to an application to exchange data. It operates on an input/output agreement, it is a distribution channel. A API is open and offered by the program owner. It is a concept and an intangible element.
